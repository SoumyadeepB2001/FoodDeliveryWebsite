			A public eating establishment similar to a restaurant is mentioned in a 512 BC record from Ancient Egypt.
			The establishment served only one dish, a plate of cereal, wild fowl, and onions.

			A forerunner of the modern restaurant is the Thermopolium, small restaurant-bars in Ancient Greece and
			Ancient Rome which offered ready-to-eat food and drinks. These establishments were somewhat comparable to
			modern fast food restaurants. They were most often frequented by people who lacked private kitchens. In the
			Roman Empire they were popular among residents of insulae.

			In Pompeii, 158 thermopolia with service counters have been identified throughout the town. They were
			concentrated along the main axis of the town and the public spaces where they were frequented by the
			locals.

			Another early forerunner of the restaurant was the inn. Throughout the ancient world, inns were set up
			alongside roads to cater to people traveling between cities, offering lodging and food. Meals were typically
			served at a common table to guests. However, there were no menus or options to choose from.

			The Arthashastra also references establishments where prepared food was sold in ancient India. One
			regulation states that "those who trade in cooked rice, liquor, and flesh" are to live in the south of the
			city. Another states that superintendents of storehouses may give surpluses of bran and flour to "those who
			prepare cooked rice, and rice-cakes", while a regulation involving city superintendents references "sellers
			of cooked flesh and cooked rice."

			The first eating establishments recognizable as restaurants in the modern sense emerged in Song dynasty
			China during the 11th and 12th centuries. In large cities such as Kaifeng and Hangzhou, food catering
			establishments were set up to cater to merchants traveling between cities. The first such establishments
			emerged in Kaifeng, China's capital at this time. Probably growing out of the tea houses and taverns that
			catered to travellers, Kaifeng's restaurants blossomed into an industry catering to locals as well as people
			from other regions of China. As traveling merchants were not used to local cuisine in the cities they
			traveled to, these establishments were set up to serve dishes local to places merchants from other parts of
			China came from. They were located in entertainment districts of major cities which catered to business
			travelers, alongside hotels, bars, and brothels. The larger and more opulent of these establishments offered
			a dining experience which in some ways was similar to modern restaurant culture. According to a Chinese
			manuscript from 1126, patrons of one such establishment were greeted with a selection of pre-plated
			demonstration dishes representing food options. Customers had their orders taken by a team of waiters who
			would then sing their orders to the kitchen and distribute the dishes in the exact order in which they had
			been ordered.

			There is a direct correlation between the growth of the restaurant businesses and institutions of theatrical
			stage drama, gambling and prostitution which served the burgeoning merchant middle class during the Song
			dynasty. Restaurants catered to different styles of cuisine, price brackets, and religious requirements.
			Even within a single restaurant choices were available, and people ordered the entree from written
			menus. An account from 1275 writes of Hangzhou, the capital city for the last half of the dynasty:

			The people of Hangzhou are very difficult to please. Hundreds of orders are given on all sides: this person
			wants something hot, another something cold, a third something tepid, a fourth something chilled. one wants
			cooked food, another raw, another chooses roast, another grill.

			The restaurants in Hangzhou also catered to many northern Chinese who had fled south from Kaifeng during the
			Jurchen invasion of the 1120s, while it is also known that many restaurants were run by families formerly
			from Kaifeng.

			In Japan, a restaurant culture emerged in the 16th century out of local tea houses. Tea house owner Sen no
			Rikyū created the kaiseki multi-course meal tradition, and his grandsons expanded the tradition to include
			speciality dishes and cutlery which matched the aesthetic of the food.

			In Europe, inns which offered food and lodgings and taverns where food was served alongside alcoholic
			beverages continued to be the main places to buy a prepared meal into the Middle Ages and Renaissance. They
			typically served common fare of the type normally available to peasants. In Spain, such establishments were
			called bodegas and served tapas. In England, they typically served foods such as sausage and shepherd's
			pie.

			France in particular has a rich history with the development of various forms of inns and eateries,
			eventually to form many of the now-ubiquitous elements of the modern restaurant. As far back as the
			thirteenth century, French inns served a variety of food — bread, cheese, bacon, roasts, soups, and stews -
			usually eaten at a common table. Parisians could buy what was essentially take-out food from rôtisseurs, who
			prepared roasted meat dishes, and pastry-cooks, who could prepare meat pies and often more elaborate dishes.
			Municipal statutes stated that the official prices per item were to be posted at the entrance; this was the
			first official mention of menus.

			Taverns also served food, as did cabarets. A cabaret, however, unlike a tavern, served food at tables with
			tablecloths, provided drinks with the meal, and charged by the customers' choice of dish, rather than by the
			pot. Cabarets were reputed to serve better food than taverns and a few, such as the Petit Maure, became
			well-known. A few cabarets had musicians or singing, but most, until the late 19th century, were simply
			convivial eating places. The first café opened in Paris in 1672 at the Saint-Germain fair. By 1723
			there were nearly four hundred cafés in Paris, but their menu was limited to simpler dishes or
			confectionaries, such as coffee, tea, chocolate (the drink; chocolate in solid state was invented only in
			the 19th century), ice creams, pastries, and liqueurs.

			At the end of the 16th century, the guild of cook-caterers (later known as "traiteurs") was given its own
			legal status. The traiteurs dominated sophisticated food service, delivering or preparing meals for the
			wealthy at their residences. Taverns and cabarets were limited to serving little more than roast or grilled
			meats. Towards the end of the seventeenth century, both inns and then traiteurs began to offer "host's
			tables" (tables d'hôte), where one paid a set price to sit at a large table with other guests and eat a
			fixed menu meal.

			The earliest modern-format "restaurants" to use that name in Paris were the establishments which served
			bouillon, a broth made of meat and egg which was said to restore health and vigor. The first restaurant of
			this kind opened in 1765 or 1766 by Mathurin Roze de Chantoiseau on rue des Poulies, now part of the Rue de
			Louvre. The name of the owner is sometimes given as Boulanger. Unlike earlier eating places, it was
			elegantly decorated, and besides meat broth offered a menu of several other "restorative" dishes, including
			macaroni. Chantoiseau and other chefs took the title "traiteurs-restaurateurs". While not the first
			establishment where one could order food, or even soups, it is thought to be the first to offer a menu of
			available choices.

			In the Western world, the concept of a restaurant as a public venue where waiting staff serve patrons food
			from a fixed menu is a relatively recent one, dating from the late 18th century. Modern restaurant
			culture originated in France during the 1780s.

			In June 1786, the Provost of Paris issued a decree giving the new kind of eating establishment official
			status, authorizing restaurateurs to receive clients and to offer them meals until eleven in the evening in
			winter and midnight in summer. Ambitious cooks from noble households began to open more elaborate eating
			places. The first luxury restaurant in Paris, the La Grande Taverne des Londres, was opened at the
			Palais-Royal at the beginning of 1786 by Antoine Beauvilliers, the former chef of the Count of Provence, It
			had mahogany tables, linen tablecloths, chandeliers, well-dressed and trained waiters, a long wine list and
			an extensive menu of elaborately prepared and presented dishes. Dishes on the restaurant menu included
			partridge with cabbage, veal chops grilled in buttered paper, and duck with turnips. This is considered
			to have been the "first real restaurant." According to Brillat-Savarin, the restaurant was "the
			first to combine the four essentials of an elegant room, smart waiters, a choice cellar, and superior
			cooking".

			The aftermath of the French Revolution saw the number of restaurants skyrocket. Due to the mass emigration
			of nobles from the country, many cooks from aristocratic households who were left unemployed went on to
			found new restaurants. One restaurant was started in 1791 by Méot, the former chef of the Duke of
			Orleans, which offered a wine list with twenty-two choices of red wine and twenty-seven of white wine. By
			the end of the century there were a collection of luxury restaurants at the Grand-Palais: Huré, the Couvert
			espagnol; Février; the Grotte flamande; Véry, Masse and the Café de Chartres (still open, now Le Grand
			Vefour)

			In 1802 the term was applied to an establishment where restorative foods, such as bouillon, a meat broth,
			were served ("établissement de restaurateur"). The disestablishment of culinary guilds and societal
			changes resulting from the industrial revolution contributed significantly to the increased prevalence of
			restaurants in Europe.
